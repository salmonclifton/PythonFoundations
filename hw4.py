"""
Define two lists at the top of your file such as the ones below:

names = ["Aliyah", "Bob", "Cathy", "Dan", "Ed", "Frank", "Darnell",
    "Gary", "Shanice", "Irene", "Jack", "Kelly", "Demetrius"]
ages = [20, 21, 18, 18, 19, 20, 20, 19, 19, 19, 22, 19, 30]
These lists should match up, so Aliyah's age is 20, Bobâ€™s age is 21, and so on. In this example,
the names should be the keys and the age should be the value.

Use the zip function to merge these lists into a dictionary.
Include a comment - What data type does zip() return?
Include a comment - How do you coerce that to the right data type?
Give a the user 5 tries to check to see if a name is in the dictionary
give them up to five tries by using a sentinel variable
use a while loop to continue to ask if they haven't found a name in the dictionary or until they run out of tries
ask the user to input a name
check if the name is in the dictionary (hint: use membership or get)
if the user is in the dictionary, return the user's age
if the user is not in the dictionary, return an error message
Your program should print out the response, as follows:

"Please input an user to find out their age: "
"Aliyah"
"Aliyah is 20!"

"Please input an user to find out their age: "
"Tabitha"
"There is nobody here named Tabitha, please try again: "
